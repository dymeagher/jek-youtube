<p>Holy shit! Whale sharks are so awesome, but Steve kept on insisting that he would not snorkely with them. I don't to stop being suck a pussy, but he persisted.  This is an excellent example on Steve doubling down on being weak.</p>

<p>Eveyone should see whale sharks, especially after a couple od nights out in Manila.</p>
